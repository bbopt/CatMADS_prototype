Quad model search strategy used by DMultiMads to generate trial points. \n  \n . Arguments: Quad model search strategy in: \n     DMS   : uses the Direct MultiSearch strategy proposed for the Direct \n     MultiSearch algorithm. The Quad Model search tries to find new non- \n     dominated points by minimizing subsets of objectives in a local region \n     centered around the current frame center; starting from one objective, \n     until minimizing all objectives at the same time. At each level of \n     combinations, the search checks if it finds a non-dominated solution. \n     Otherwise, it increases the number of objectives considered. In the \n     worst case, this strategy has to solve 2^nobj - 1 subproblems, that \n     can be costly. \n     DOM   : uses the Dominance Move strategy. In this case, the Quad model \n     search tries to minimize a 'dominance move' single-objective function, \n     and explores the objective space towards new non-dominated solutions \n     according to the current set of solutions. \n     MULTI : uses the MultiMads strategy. When the current frame center \n     is an extreme solution of the current set of solutions, i.e., it \n     minimizes one of the objective components, the Quad model search \n     starts an expansion phase: it then tries to minimize further the \n     considering objective component. Otherwise, the Quad model search \n     tries to find new non-dominated solutions in a local region of \n     the objective space defined by the current frame center and some \n     of its 'closest' neighbors. \n  \n .
