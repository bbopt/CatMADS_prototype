DiscoMads optimization: reveal and escape either weak discontinuities \n in revealing outputs or hidden constraints regions (with DISCO_MADS_HID_CONST). \n  \n . If DiscoMads is used for discontinuities, they are characterized by  \n DISCO_MADS_DETECTION_RADIUS and DISCO_MADS_LIMIT_RATE.  Revealing outputs \n  should be indicated by appending -R to blackbox outputs type in parameters file. \n  \n . Prescribed distance to revealing points is controlled by  \n DISCO_MADS_EXCLUSION_RADIUS. \n  \n . Revealing poll parameters are DISCO_MADS_REVEALING_POLL_NB_POINTS and \n DISCO_MADS_REVEALING_POLL_RADIUS. \n  \n . Argument: bool \n  \n . Example: DISCO_MADS_OPTIMIZATION true \n  \n .

DiscoMADS algorithm attempts to reveal discontinuities between couple of \n points whose distance is strictly less than this value. \n  \n . Argument: greater than or equal to 0.
