This \n defines min and max bounds, from which we define a model center. The model \n search is limited to tighter (can be wider with the parameter set to less than 1) \n bounds by reducing the distance of the optimization bounds to the model center. \n We use a reduction factor for that. If the reduction factor equals one, the min \n and max bounds are used as optimization bounds for the search. The greater the \n reduction factor, the tighter the bounds. \n  \n .
