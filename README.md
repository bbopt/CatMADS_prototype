# CatMADS_prototype
Prototype implementation of CatMADS for the paper *CatMADS: MESH ADAPTIVE DIRECT-SEARCH FOR CONSTRAINED BLACKBOX1
OPTIMIZATION WITH CATEGORICAL VARIABLES*.

The current code is a proof of concept, and the project remains under active development.

This repository contains 32 analytical mixed-variable optimization problems, including 16 constrained ones, for benchmarking.
